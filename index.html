        <p class="lead">Hello! Welcome to my Home page. I am currently a 2nd year student at California State University of Long Beach and I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I started having interest in coding ever since high school, at the time I was programming VEX IQ and VEX Cortex robots. I was also taking Engineering Design, where I had the opportunity to learn Solidworks as well as learning code for Arduino. As of recent, I had participated in TuffyHacks, which was an online hackathon event hosted at California State University of Fullerton. For the event, me and my team coded a fruit catching game with pygame, which was a free Open Source Python programming library. A few of my personal interests are skating, playing badminton, watching Korean drama and anime. Besides that, I love traveling, meeting new people, and making friends, if you would like to contact me or you have any questions, feel free to send me an email.</p>
